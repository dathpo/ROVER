Notes from meeting 28/11/16


Over the weekend Paul has established that the segfaults in the Arduino executions were being caused by errors in the STL library. Unfortunately this is not a quick fix, as we rely on this library throughout the code, so we will not have a live demo tomorrow.


PRESENTATION

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DEKlFuR7fFuEdrvvo42mWcFi5WNAkwgT66iXIDaPzkI/edit?usp=sharing

DavidD - Project management, goals/requirements/use cases, Services
Paul - High-level system design, UML diagram
Jack - Message spec document
DavidP - Packet and PacketQueue classes, byte stuffing
Kyle - Service and ServiceTable classes
Gary - Message passing and queuing, website
Pete - Resource discovery algorithm
Andrew - Initialisation procedure
Everyone - Q and A


FUTURE WORK

Next - port to Pi and see if it works using standard library. Then implement data structures for Arduino and replace STL references. Once message generation/routing works, we need to implement resource discovery and node initialisation. Then we will start expanding on the application layer on top of the Comms protocol, such as building publish/subscribe functionality or RPC.


ROVER NIGHT OUT

Suggested Rover night out on Saturday 3/12 or next week. TBC after presentation.
