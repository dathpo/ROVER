Photoshoot for VIP conference

Current expenditure is approx. Â£1000, which is in line with budget.

VIP conference organisation - doodle poll for availability. Stephen in charge of organisation. Three posters, one for each team. Brief overview at the top of each of the three posters, with some overlap, but focus on team-specific aspects and goals. Poster templates in email from Mark. One abstract for the whole VIP - each team needs to contribute to that. Perhaps a variation of the pitch already written at the end of last  year?

New risk assessment required for electrical team to work in RC353. Needs to be one risk assessment for the whole of ROVER. Risk assessment will be on Google Docs and should be edited by everyone to make sure it covers all eventualities for any work that any team needs to do in the EEE labs. Safety training sessions need to be organised by Dr Harle for second-years.
